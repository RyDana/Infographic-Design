# Project2

Project consisted of analyzing the YouTube Video of Apple's iPhone 12 event.

Spoken text was extracted by downloading the subtitles.


They were then analyzed computationally to:
    1) find the most frequently words used and
    2) the timestamp that these words were used.

Sectioning of the event according to subject of the discussion was done by hand.

Noting the timestamps of appearance of different speakers was done manually as well.

The resulting infographic was created using the p5.js library, a JavaScript Library used for graphics creation.

To find the data used for this project, consult the assets/annex folder.
